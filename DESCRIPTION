Description: Humans often have problems generating truely random sequences of 
    numbers or letters. The extent to which we are able to behave randomly
    can be assessed with a variety of algorithms. These algorithms check for
    different characteristics that a random sequence sequence should fullfil.
    The implemented indices of randomness are based on the work of Ginsburg &
    Karpiuk (1994, <doi:10.2466/pms.1994.79.3.1059>), Towse & Neil (1998,
    <https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03209475>), and Skliar, Monge, Oviedo, & Medina 
    (2009, <doi:10.15517/rmta.v16i1.1418>).
