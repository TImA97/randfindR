# randseq

This is a package for the programming language R in development for the analysis of randomness in sequences of distinct options (e.g., numbers or letters). randseq can help you determine with several of indices how systematic a sequence of options is according to different benchmarks of randomness. Its focus lies on the detection of patterns that are typically found in human generated sequences.
