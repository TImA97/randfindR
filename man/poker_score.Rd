\title{Poker Score}
\usage{
poker_score(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector of distinct options of numbers or characters}
}
\value{
poker score of \code{x}
}
\description{
Compute number of times exactly two responses of the same value
occur after division of the complete sequence into 5-digit-long sub-sequences
}
\details{
This function takes a vector \code{x} and computes the frequency with
which exactly two identical values occur in 5-digit-long sub-sequences of the
original vector (2 in 5). If the vector length is not dividable by 5, the last 1-4
values will not be used for the computation. This index is a measure of repetition
in a sequence. Its values range from 0 (no 2 in 5) to (length of \code{x}) / 5
(always a 2 in 5 for each sub-sequence).
