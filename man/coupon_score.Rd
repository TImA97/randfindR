\usage{
coupon_score(x, options)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector of random numbers}

\item{options}{number of available options in sequence}
}
\value{
Coupon Score of \code{x}
}
\description{
Compute average digit length required for all responses to occur
}
\details{
This function takes a vector \code{x} and computes the mean length of values
that is required for all possible \code{options} to occur. A sub-string of
a vector is considered a complete set if all \code{options} occur.
Incomplete sets of responses at the end of a sequence with at least one
option omitted are not used for the computation of this index.
Consequently, this index cannot be computed for for vectors that do not
contain all possible \code{options} and therefore, NA is returned.
